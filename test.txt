Here is what wiki says about transpositoin errors:
Transcription and transposition errors are found everywhere,
even in professoinal articles in newspapers or books whether fictional or factual.
They can be missed by editors quite simply, just as they can be typed quite simply.
The most obvious cure for the errors is for the user to watch the screen when they type,
and to proof read. If the entry is occurring in data capture forms, databases or subscription forms,
the coder of the forms or the database administrator should use input masks or validation rules.
Transcription and transposition errors may also occur in syntax when Computer programming or programming within variable declaration or within coding parameters 
 this should be checked by proof reading
 however syntax errors may be picked up by the program the author is using
 Common desktop publishing and word processing applications use spell checkers and grammar checkers which may pick up on some transcription
transposition errors 
 not all errors may be picked up however
 as some errors may form new words which fit grammatically
 For instance if the user wished to write 
The fog was dense but instaed put The dog was dense
 a grammar and spell checker would not notify the user because both phrases are grammatically correct
 as is the spelling of the word dog and fog
 Unfortunately the situation regarding these errors is likely to get worse before it gets better
 as workload for users and workers regarding manual direct data entry (DDE) devices increases.
